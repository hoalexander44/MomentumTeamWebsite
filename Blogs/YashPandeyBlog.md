o 10 Hours  

- Debugging and Troubleshooting with Bugs and Integration issues

Total Hours: 12 Hours

Positive: The game website is no longer just a bunch of links slapped onto one webpage. It has become a little more diverse, a little more artisic and a whole lot better.


Negative: The AI still wasn't integrated into the game making testing it impossible. Further, development of the upgraded website is a lot more tedious than expected which led to a pretty long time needed to develop and debug it (since it all happens behind the scenes) 

Upcoming: 
- Finish adding more assets on our website and flesh it out with pictures of devs, images of concept art, etc.
- Enemy AI integration

### Week 10

## -- Post Mortem --

The project itself started out with everyone in high spirits (as pojects often do). And even towards the end, I felt that despite every other class being in the belief that "The work for my class is more important than the others and so, priortitze this over anything else", I never felt that the team was "lacking" or "falling behind" with things. There were bumps along the road, there were setbacks, discussions, going back and forth, but at the end of meetings, everyone had an idea of what needed to be done and that inspired confidence within the team itself.
Initially, all the programmers were doing a little bit of everything everywhere but as we got to the later half of the quarter, everyone had some larger chunk of the game they were tackling piece by piece. I had the Enemy AI. The enemy AI presented in the golden build was NOT the AI I developed but a simplified basic enemy AI. Issues with integration persisted for the last month of the development process for me and not having the breathing room (due to a personal emergency and classes) to sit down and iron these issues out really pushed me towards developing imposter syndrome.
This week, I had spent some time working with other developers to integrate the AI but my finals schedule didn't allow me to sit down and see it through. We ran into issues when it came to pathing for multiple enemies but it worked perfectly for one enemy on the screen. The lack of integration was a fault on my part and given the chance to, I am confident in my ability to integrate this into the game. 
The website I spent some time adding to was scrapped for Alex had a better vision for what it should look like and I prefer the website he created over mine too.
There was a crisis week in the middle of the quarter which caused us to realize and re-evaluate our developing process and the issues since has decreased significantly.

Positives:
  - Everyone stayed on top of their designated work
  - The communication and feedback amongst peers really helped pull this project together
  - Everyone had a clear idea of the vision of the game and the direction to take it in

Things to Work on:
  - Finish the AI implementation (overdue)
  - Create a dialogue sequence (and all its sub-requirements) to introduce the story to the player
  - Break down story into arcs and update game documentation to represent the same

Overall, I have been excited by this process of developing this project through and through (often was the best part of the week) but I find myself needing to improve on my time management and allocation techniques. I think the game really came together despite the discussions in the middle of the week about the direction we want to take this game and the delay that came along with the enemy AI but I'm sure with more time, we can really make turn this project into a successful product

#### Summer 2021 begins here!

### Week 1 - 2
Yash Pandey, PPJ1 

Tasks - Hours Taken:

- New Team Orientation/Integration
o 3 Hours  


- Story Development
o 3 Hours  
Total Hours: 6 Hours

Positive: Was able to get a story team together and hammer down some important details. Further, the new additions to our team have not raised any concerns which gave way for a smooth-ish integration into our team but I'm sure eventually, the questions will pour in

Negative: There are going to be a lot of questions about "Ooh what about this...?", "Where can I find ____?", and "How do I do this?". Made me realize the need for documentation of the process for helping with onboarding in a team to get everyone up to par. Hopefully in a more professional setting, there could be a team dedicated to this.

Upcoming: 
- Fix improved AI implementation
- Create a dialogue system! (in scope for this quarter)
- Create dialogues for the characters.

Yash Pandey, PPJ2 

Tasks - Hours Taken:

o 5 Hours  


- Story Development
o 1 Hours  
Total Hours: 6 Hours

Positive: Was able to finally recreate the issues with the implementation of the AI and fix a major chunk

Upcoming: 
- Finish improved AI implementation
- Create dialogues for the characters.

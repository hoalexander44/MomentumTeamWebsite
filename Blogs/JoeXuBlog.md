Joe Xu, PPJ 1
Tasks:

1. Meet with the whole team and discussed about our roles. Evaluate ourselves and what we can do : 2 hours

2. Talked with the programming team and learned how the code is working. 1.5 hours

Total Hours: 3.5 hours

Positives: We discussed a lot on the first meeting and I'm pretty exciting to join team Momentum. We clarified on our roles in the team. I think we had a great start.
Negatives: It was hard to catch up on a new game in this short amount of time. I think there is still a lot more to learn to understand how the game is working in the current phase.
Upcoming: Alex is gonna assign tasks for us next week and it will give me a better understanding of my role/job in the team.

## Welcome to Jack Wheeler's Personal Production Journal

### Week 1 - Week 2
Jack Wheeler, PPJ 1

Tasks:
  -Various group meetings: 3.5 hours
  -Total: 3.5 hours
Positives: I am excited to be able to work on a new game to change things up a bit from last quarter. I really like the idea of Momentum, and I think that I should be able to work well with it because I have played somewhat similar games in the past.

Negatives: Getting familliar with the code of a game halfway through its production is not something that can be easily done in a relatively short amount of time. That goes for both the people learning the code, as well as the people teaching the new group members how the code is written. The meeting for the programmers went on for more than an hour, and I can confidently say that I had extremely good insight to start recording it with OBS right when it started so that I can watch it as many times as I want.

### Postmortem  

So overall this project was really fun to work on and it gave me experience working on a game project in a big group. I think that the team was great. Everyone got along with each other and treated one another with respect. I think that what we wanted by the end of the term was achieved at a point where we could be satisfied. 

So what went right. When first starting the project we were able to give everyone a task that played to their skills and no one was doing something that they did not enjoy working on. Also having meetings weekly to check in on progress outside of class was very crucial. I will say that I could not make some of the meetings due to out of school issues. However we always made notes of the meeting. So that if anyone was to miss the meeting they could look at the notes from that meeting, and know where everyone was with production. Also the implementation of the trello board was very great. We were able to delegate tasks to everyone and able to mark off jobs that were completed. Also just overall producing a game with visuals and music is also amazing. 
	
So what went wrong then? Well for starters on my end I was unable to produce art at the level I wanted to due to my hardware breaking. So for that I gave more of the complex art to Matt because he had a good sense of the art anyways. While I started to focus more on the UI portion and make visuals for those elements. Another issue I think that went south was how we explained the game to our testers. When playtesting most of the testers said they had no idea on how to play and didnâ€™t understand the concept. So it was on our end of not making the directions not clear enough. One more thing that went wrong was just some of the time it took to implement some assets in the game in terms of the art. We had a bunch of art that was made for the game but it took a lot of time to get implemented and so we didn't know what people thought of it till way later in production. 

However I still think the work that was done on this team is still amazing. There are lessons I want to take away from this project. One idea is to make a concept that is fun and enjoyable for people to play. So taking a small aspect of a game and trying to see how far we can take that idea and form it into a game. Also just overall production checkups and make sure everyone is on the same page and try to get assets implemented on time to see how people think of the look.

### Finals Week

Personal Postmortem

Things that went right:
- Smooth Pipeline
- Game grew significantly over the weeks
- Good team synergy

Things that went wrong:
- Scope issues
- Game Mechanic bugs
- Some miscommunication early on

Lessons Learned:
Having weekly meetings are a must. Having a trello board to look back on in case people forget tasks is a must.
In terms of other projects I think have clearer communcation and sticking to game mechaincs and trying it out for the long term can help the direction of the game not to zigzag around.

## TERM TWO PPJ


## Welcome to Diego's Personal Production Journal


### Week 2 - Week 3
Diego Varona, PPJ 1


Full Team Meeting: 3 hours
Pipeline docment: 1 hour


Total: 4 hours


Positive: Onboarding was smoother than expected and everyone has been delegated a role that they would like to do. Seeing more programmers on the team really makes me happy because it means we can get more complex game mechanics out


Negative: Nothing really big happened this week due to onboarding everyone and making sure that was running and good to go. 


Future Plan: Start going through the GDD and cleaning everything up a little more. 


### Week 3 - Week 4
Diego Varona, PPJ 2

GDD Meeting: 1 hour
Created SCRUM: 15 Minutes
Team Meeting: 15 Minutes

Total: 1.5 hours


Positive: The GDD Meeting was relatively straightforward and was a great way to pull in the scope of the game. It was also a great time to see what game mechanics need tweakings or could use changes in the future.

Negative: Unfortunately the time we had the GDD meeting, the main team meeting got pushed up and overlapped with the our meeting so we got a little sidetracked and I had to leave early due to a prior obligation. 


Future Plan: With the level builder being almost done I think we can start designing levels for the first time.

### Week 4 - Week 5
Diego, PPJ 3

GDD Meeting: 1 hour
Over-seeing Playtests: 3 Hours

Total: 4 hours


Positive: Once again the GDD meeting went smoothly, outlining what needs to be done within the term as well as getting everything in order gameplay wise so we know what to do moving forward. The playtests also went smoothly since I got most of the same people to playtest again, it seems they like the new mechanic!

Negative: It still feels like I am not doing much to help the team, but I understand that as designers we do not get much to show off in terms of work.

Future Plan: Start mocking up actual levels.

### Week 5 - Week 6
Diego, PPJ 4

GDD Formatting: 1 Hour

Total: 1 hours


Positive: The GDD really feels a lot more organized now with the Table of Contents and the Changelog being added.

Negative: It still feels like I am not doing much to help the team, but I understand that as designers we do not get much to show off in terms of work.

Future Plan: When Kendall is done with the Level Builder I am really itching to gt to designing some levels.

Level Greyboxing: 2 Hours

Total: 2 hours

Positive: Nice to develop more levels and see how they take into account the design system of the game.

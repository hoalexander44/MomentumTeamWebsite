### Finals Week

Personal Postmortem

Things that went right:
- Smooth Pipeline
- Game grew significantly over the weeks
- Good team synergy

Things that went wrong:
- Scope issues
- Game Mechanic bugs
- Some miscommunication early on

Lessons Learned:
Having weekly meetings are a must. Having a trello board to look back on in case people forget tasks is a must.
In terms of other projects I think have clearer communcation and sticking to game mechaincs and trying it out for the long term can help the direction of the game not to zigzag around.

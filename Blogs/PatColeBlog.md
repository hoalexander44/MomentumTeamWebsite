## Welcome to Patrick Cole's Personal Production Journal


### Week 1 - Week 2
Patrick Cole, PPJ 1

Tasks:

1. Help flesh out the story board and write details about the levels: 2 hours

2. Team meetings: 5 Hours

Total hours: 7

Positive: I am excited to be working on Momentum. I really like the idea and love where we are taking the story.

Negative: The meetings were LONG and it felt hard to take in so much information at one time, and the programming aspects of the game are kind of complicated.

Upcoming: We plan to continue working on AI for the enemies and also finding better ways to populate enemies and generate levels. I also plan to continue to flesh out the story.

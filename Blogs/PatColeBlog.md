## Welcome to Patrick Cole's Personal Production Journal


### Week 1 - Week 2
Patrick Cole, PPJ 1

Tasks:

1. Help flesh out the story board and write details about the levels: 2 hours

2. Team meetings: 5 Hours

Total hours: 7

Positive: I am excited to be working on Momentum. I really like the idea and love where we are taking the story.

Negative: The meetings were LONG and it felt hard to take in so much information at one time, and the programming aspects of the game are kind of complicated.

Upcoming: We plan to continue working on AI for the enemies and also finding better ways to populate enemies and generate levels. I also plan to continue to flesh out the story.


### Week 2 - Week 3
Patrick Cole, PPJ 2

Tasks:

1. Fix Enemy Attack after death: 2 hours

2. Fix enemy movement bug: 5 hours (Blocked)

2. Team meetings (Overall/AI): 4 Hours

Total hours: 11

Positive: Fixing the enemy attacking after death was a relatively easy fix, also it gave me a better understanding of the flow of the turn based systems in place.

Negative: After seeing the code, I nearly had a heart attack. Some aspects of things are programmed decently but when it came to how movement is handled it quickly became an issue. We will be dealing with this for a while most likely.

Upcoming: We plan to continue working on AI for the enemies and also finding better ways to populate enemies and generate levels. Lot of bugs to fix.

This jam board was a collaborative effort mostly transcribed by Yash, but I feel it is the best example of what I have been working on this week.

Positives: The onboarding process, from what I can tell, has been successful. I am excited to work together on this game and its components!

Negetives: Aside from bringing the Altitude team up to speed, not too much was accomplished this week. There isn't much to complain about or to praise.

Next week, I will be working on story, level design, and fixing problems with the game that arise, like the tutorial.

 Tasks:
 1. Worked with Kendall to setup an in-editor level generator: 2 hours
2. Setup editor windows and GUI: 1 hour
3. Cleaned up code: 1 hour

Total: 4 hours

* Positives: This level editor should be very helpful for future additions and changes.
* Negatives: Both Kendall and I were very unavailable this week and were not able to make as much progress as we'd like.
* Upcoming: Some issues with layers still needs to be resolved with this editor, as well as anything else that needs doing in regards to the functionality or story of the game.

Tasks:
1. Worked on Player/enemy spawning in the Level Editor: 2 hours
2. Troubleshooting crashes and bugs on my side: 2 hours

Total: 4 hours


* Positives: Now that I am back at my apartment, I will be able to do much more for the project, I hope.
* Negatives: Due to the problems I encountered, I was able to make frustratingly little progress this week, and probably do not seem like a terribly valuable teammate at this moment.
* Upcoming: I will be finishing working on the level editor, investigating and fixing some bugs others ran into, and helping out with whatever else needs to be done.

Tasks:
1. Made public function in each tile to change the tile script type: 1 hour
2. Altered Enemy script to be able to change the tile the enemy was just on: 1 hour
3. Script cleanup: 1 hour

Total: 3 hours

* Positives: I was able to knock out two tasks without much issue in a way that will make future changes faster and easier.
* Negatives: I do not always feel like the work given to me is being properly communicated, and so I am having to figure out what is needed for me to do as I go with this project.
* Upcoming: I will be trying to reconfigure the layers enemies are placed on, and continue work on the LevelEditor.

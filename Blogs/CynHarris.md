This jam board was a collaborative effort mostly transcribed by Yash, but I feel it is the best example of what I have been working on this week.

Positives: The onboarding process, from what I can tell, has been successful. I am excited to work together on this game and its components!

Negetives: Aside from bringing the Altitude team up to speed, not too much was accomplished this week. There isn't much to complain about or to praise.

Next week, I will be working on story, level design, and fixing problems with the game that arise, like the tutorial.

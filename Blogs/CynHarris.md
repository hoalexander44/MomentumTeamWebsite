This jam board was a collaborative effort mostly transcribed by Yash, but I feel it is the best example of what I have been working on this week.

Positives: The onboarding process, from what I can tell, has been successful. I am excited to work together on this game and its components!

Negetives: Aside from bringing the Altitude team up to speed, not too much was accomplished this week. There isn't much to complain about or to praise.

Next week, I will be working on story, level design, and fixing problems with the game that arise, like the tutorial.

 Tasks:
 1. Worked with Kendall to setup an in-editor level generator: 2 hours
2. Setup editor windows and GUI: 1 hour
3. Cleaned up code: 1 hour

Total: 4 hours

* Positives: This level editor should be very helpful for future additions and changes.
* Negatives: Both Kendall and I were very unavailable this week and were not able to make as much progress as we'd like.
* Upcoming: Some issues with layers still needs to be resolved with this editor, as well as anything else that needs doing in regards to the functionality or story of the game.

PPJ Week 4

Tasks:
1. Worked on Player/enemy spawning in the Level Editor: 2 hours
2. Troubleshooting crashes and bugs on my side: 2 hours

Total: 4 hours


* Positives: Now that I am back at my apartment, I will be able to do much more for the project, I hope.
* Negatives: Due to the problems I encountered, I was able to make frustratingly little progress this week, and probably do not seem like a terribly valuable teammate at this moment.
* Upcoming: I will be finishing working on the level editor, investigating and fixing some bugs others ran into, and helping out with whatever else needs to be done.



PPJ Week 5

Tasks:
1. Made public function in each tile to change the tile script type: 1 hour
2. Altered Enemy script to be able to change the tile the enemy was just on: 1 hour
3. Script cleanup: 1 hour

Total: 3 hours

* Positives: I was able to knock out two tasks without much issue in a way that will make future changes faster and easier.
* Negatives: I do not always feel like the work given to me is being properly communicated, and so I am having to figure out what is needed for me to do as I go with this project.
* Upcoming: I will be trying to reconfigure the layers enemies are placed on, and continue work on the LevelEditor.

PPJ Week 6

Tasks:
1. Created script to swap the sprites out in the hex prefab- 3 hours
2. Added tile changing abilities to Numblett and Zapper: 1.5 hours
3. Fixing/refactoring code from last week based on in class suggestions: 1 hour


Total: 5.5 hours

* Positives: The hex type system is coming along nicely, and I think this will definitely add some depth to the gameplay.
* Negatives: The project in general has some issues with organization and standardization. For instance, the different tiles even given the same dimensions and pixels per units have slight shape and size deviations, so the swap process currently is quite noticeable. Hopefully this can be fixed soon.
* Upcoming: I will probably be helping with the ability of throwing a projectile, as well as potentially helping more with the LevelEditor.

PPJ Week 7

![Screenshot (283)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54598140/128022504-8a044cfd-7d94-4ca1-8a2e-bf395479659b.png)![Screenshot (282)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54598140/128022533-a644b768-620f-4c3d-a464-c8c710caf82c.png)

Tasks: 
1. Changing hex type in the inspector updates hex sprite befoe runtime- 1 hour
2. Getting the level to generate before runtime at all- 4 hours
Total- 5 hours

* Positives: We might be finally close to cracking this LevelBuilder system.
* Negatives: We have been working for so long on something that most games have without trying: being able to edit the game from the hierarchy before runtime.
* Upcoming: HOPEFULLY we fix this problem with the LevelBuilder.

PPJ Week 9

Tasks:
1. Creating the first Fire level: 1 hour
2. Creating Ice Level 2: 2 hours
Total: 3 hours

* Positives: The level system is working well, so it is much easier to make edits to levels.
* Negatives: Level building should probably be the job of fewer people than it is, as once you get used to it it is easy to make many levels while others can be working on other things.
* Upcoming: It is approaching the end of the term, so hopefully we can polish the game and bring it to a presentable state!


PPJ Week 10

Tasks:
1. Facilitating playtests: 2 hours
Total: 2 hours

* Positives: This is almost certainly going to be the most helpful playtest data we've collected. Everyone seemed to have something to say.
* Negatives: Nothing was assigned to most of us this week, which I guess makes sense as we are nearing the end, but it always feels weird to report next to nothing.
* Upcoming: Polishing and finishing off the game!

## Welcome to Christopher Epure's Personal Production Journal


### Week 2 - Week 3
Christopher Epure, PPJ 1

Tasks:

1.Collaborate on Pipeline document: 1.5 hours

2.Asset draft and evaluating team for production purposes: 1.5-2 hours

3.Commenting and adding revisions to GDD: 2-3 hours.

Total Hours: 5-8 hours

Positives: Once meetings went through and people got to interact, concerns in regards to task assignment and rolse mellowed. Was initially skeptical because of the size of the team, but everone was onboard at some point. 

Negatives: Was reletively confused when trying to catch of the current state of the game with the GDD. Certain aspects weren't outlined as clearly, however this left room to comment and figure out what aspects were missing. A lot of these issues were ironed throughout the week, or elaborated on during meetings.

Upcoming: Coming up I will likely go through the comments in the GDD to do edits/revisions (slight wait based on how a text goes for the game). Will also look into editing current assets for cohesion.

### Week 3 - Week 4
Chrisopther Epure, PPJ 2

Tasks:

1.Comments and revisions to GDD: 2-3 hours

2.Style guides and studies for what to take from designs: 1-2 Hours

3.Playtest form: 1 hour

4. Testing new version and gauging edits of current enemy types: 1 hour

Total hours: 5-7 hours

Positives: Relatively straight foreward progress being made from all members of the team. The ideas for modifying the game have been turning out to be effective, so it's going to be easier going forward to consider concepts for enemies and obstructing the player

Negatives: Some wild concerns as far as consolidation and how east it will be to do revisions on the monsters, but other than that not many concerns.

Upcoming: Going forward I will probably work more to the art end to see what are modifcations to be made for environment consistency, and working on monster redraws. Will likely work as well on GDD modifications for future enemy plans based on the current functionality of the game.

### Week 4 - Week 5
Christopher Epure, PPJ 3
Tasks:

1. Comments and revisions to GDD: 1-2 hours

2. Art direction and style guides: 2-3 hours

3. Mock up bases: .5 hours

4.Playtest data compile and evaluation: 1 hour

Positives: Points and disscusions around art edits went smoothly. Some monsters will need assesment based on whether or not the designs should remain if reanimating is in the cards, but other than that revisions have been straight forward in terms of color explanations.

Negatives: Playtest data was last minute for pretty much everyone. I had issues finding persons willing to test game initally, and most other people had only got responses within the last 12 hours because we would rather focus on system stuff. Generally speaking when evaluating playtest data, a lot of the questions in post are not the most effective in evaulating the current state of the game, and even on question provides and answer that (due to the forms being compiled innately) comprimises the data set when put together.

Upcoming: Working on UI mock ups, continued editing and re evaluation of art assets and GDD edits.

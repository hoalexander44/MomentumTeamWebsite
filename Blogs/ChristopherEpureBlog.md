### Week 2 - Week 3
Christopher Epure, PPJ 1

Tasks:

1.Collaborate on Pipeline document: 1.5 hours

2.Asset draft and evaluating team for production purposes: 1.5-2 hours

3.Commenting and adding revisions to GDD: 2-3 hours.

Total Hours: 5-8 hours

Positives: Once meetings went through and people got to interact, concerns in regards to task assignment and rolse mellowed. Was initially skeptical because of the size of the team, but everone was onboard at some point. 

Negatives: Was reletively confused when trying to catch of the current state of the game with the GDD. Certain aspects weren't outlined as clearly, however this left room to comment and figure out what aspects were missing. A lot of these issues were ironed throughout the week, or elaborated on during meetings.

Upcoming: Coming up I will likely go through the comments in the GDD to do edits/revisions (slight wait based on how a text goes for the game). Will also look into editing current assets for cohesion.

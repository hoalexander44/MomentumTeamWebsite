### Week 1 - Week 2
Jarod Mellus - PPJ #1

Tasks: 3.5 hours for meetings, designation of roles, upcoming tasks, and asset lists.
       1.5 hours assembling some supplies for foley

Total Hours: 5

Positives: I'm excited to get to work on foley and sfx as a dedicated role. There's a lot of talent to go around on the team which means we have the liberty to designate more specific roles to individuals, which should bolster the quality of output. I also love how clear my tasks are for the next couple of weeks. We have an asset list timeline, so I pretty much know what I need to get done and when I need to get it done.

Negatives:
Nothing really so far. Getting aquainted with a project you're new on is always a bit difficult but not impossible. 

### Week 2 - Week 3
Jarod Mellus - PPJ #2

Tasks: 3 hours setting up sound effect system with placeholder assets.

Positives: I learned plenty about the project this week going through the various scripts that make it run. I now have a better grasp on how movement, momentum, and attacking works because I had to place placeholder sound effects in for each of these.

Negatives: Still nothing too bad this week. We probably could have gotten more done but people are busy with the start of classes so it's understandable.

### Week 3 - Week 4
Jarod Mellus - PPJ #2

Tasks: 3 hours expanding sound effect functionality for more sounds like clicking and hovering over hexes, player, enemies, etc. 

Positives: I believe I've set a good structure for our sound system going forward and am excited to focus on creating some of the sounds for this game and moving away from placeholders.

Negatives: I really wish I had more time to work, but Monday is one of my only days off in the week and my power was out for most of the day so I wasn't able to
get as much completed as I intended.


### Week 4 - Week 5
Jarod Mellus - PPJ #2

Tasks: 3 hours recording foley, 2 hours attempting layering of sounds

Positives: I feel I got some pretty good recordings for hits, sword slashes, grunts, etc. 

Negatives: I wasn't as transparent as I could have been about my work week and should be more communicative in the future.

### Week - 4 - Week 6

Tasks: 3 hours expanding functionality, 2 hours doing layering, 

Positives: I think I'm about done adding audio functionality to the game project. Most core events have a cooresponding sfx, so I think I have a solid basis to just make sounds from here on out.

Negatives: I had a lot of failures with layering and had to redo or completely restart some of the sounds. A lot of the grunts I performed sounded better out of context, and sorta terrible in context. I ended up prioritizing just getting more placeholders in to fill gaps. I plan to change workflows and switch over to logic pro to finish sounds. I find that to be way more user friendly then audacity, but there are some pains getting it between my computers.

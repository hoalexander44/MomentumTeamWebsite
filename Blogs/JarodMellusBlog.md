### Week 1 - Week 2
Jarod Mellus - PPJ #1

Tasks: 3.5 hours for meetings, designation of roles, upcoming tasks, and asset lists.
       1.5 hours assembling some supplies for foley

Total Hours: 5

Positives: I'm excited to get to work on foley and sfx as a dedicated role. There's a lot of talent to go around on the team which means we have the liberty to designate more specific roles to individuals, which should bolster the quality of output. I also love how clear my tasks are for the next couple of weeks. We have an asset list timeline, so I pretty much know what I need to get done and when I need to get it done.

Negatives:
Nothing really so far. Getting aquainted with a project you're new on is always a bit difficult but not impossible.

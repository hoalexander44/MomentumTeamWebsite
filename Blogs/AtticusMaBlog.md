### PPJ01

Atticus Ma, PPJ01

Tasks: 

1. Onboarding Meeting: 3 hours

Total hours: 3 hours

Positive: This week was just mostly about onboarding the Altitude team into the Momentum team, which includes me. The meeting was very informative and gave me a good look on what the goals of the Momentum are. There was also another meeting right after for the programamers where the Momentum programmers explained to the Altitude programmers how their game worked. Overall, the onboarding process went very smoothly and gave us Altitude people a good understanding of what Momentum should be. 

Negative: Only negative I had was that I could not attend the entirety of the programmers' meeting. Luckily it is recorded and I can watch it later to catch up. 

Upcoming: I look forward to my first task on programming. 

### PPJ02

Atticus Ma, PPJ02

Tasks: 

1. Meeting with Michael: 1/2 hour
2. Reviewing code: 1 1/2 hours

Total hours: 2 1/2 hours

Positive: The meeting with Michael was very informative since we are working together on a ticket. He showed me at what scripts to look at and helped me understand how everything works. Besides the meeting, I took some time to look at all the scripts for Momentum to help get a better grasp of what to do for my ticket. 

Negative: Family matters unfortunately appeared out of no where and I had to miss our group meeting. I am a little behind as of now and need to catch up with the rest of the group. 

Upcoming: This week I look forward to working on the current ticket I have on Trello and work on fixing the sliding mechanic. Hopefully there aren't anymore random events that prevent me from attending the meetings. 

### PPJ03

Atticus Ma, PPJ03

Tasks: 

1. Refactoring code for sliding mechanic: 4 hours
2. Debugging slide mechanic: 2 hours

Total hours: 6 hours

Positive: Unlike last week, I was able to accomplish my ticket on time and learned a lot from the experience. Most of the programming was partner programming with Michael and 
we were able to compare each others' ideas and figure out the best solution for refactoring the slide mechanic. It is basically polished and needs a little more bug testing before we merge it into the actual game. I was also happy that I could attend all the meetings that my group held. 

Negative: Only negatives were that our programming usually had to be near night time which was a bit of annoying due to family matters and overall scheduling. 

Upcoming: This week I look forward to working on refactoring the abilities hopefully since we changed our gameplay loop. Due to the new gameplay loop, some of the abilities seem a little too over powered and might need a bit of adjustment.

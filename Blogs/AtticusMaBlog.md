Atticus Ma, PPJ01

Tasks: 

1. Onboarding Meeting: 3 hours

Total hours: 3 hours

Positive: This week was just mostly about onboarding the Altitude team into the Momentum team, which includes me. The meeting was very informative and gave me a good look on what the goals of the Momentum are. There was also another meeting right after for the programamers where the Momentum programmers explained to the Altitude programmers how their game worked. Overall, the onboarding process went very smoothly and gave us Altitude people a good understanding of what Momentum should be. 

Negative: Only negative I had was that I could not attend the entirety of the programmers' meeting. Luckily it is recorded and I can watch it later to catch up. 

Upcoming: I look forward to my first task on programming.

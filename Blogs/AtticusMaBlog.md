### PPJ01

Atticus Ma, PPJ01

Tasks: 

1. Onboarding Meeting: 3 hours

Total hours: 3 hours

Positive: This week was just mostly about onboarding the Altitude team into the Momentum team, which includes me. The meeting was very informative and gave me a good look on what the goals of the Momentum are. There was also another meeting right after for the programamers where the Momentum programmers explained to the Altitude programmers how their game worked. Overall, the onboarding process went very smoothly and gave us Altitude people a good understanding of what Momentum should be. 

Negative: Only negative I had was that I could not attend the entirety of the programmers' meeting. Luckily it is recorded and I can watch it later to catch up. 

Upcoming: I look forward to my first task on programming. 

### PPJ02

Atticus Ma, PPJ012

Tasks: 

1. Meeting with Michael: 1/2 hour
2. Reviewing code: 1 1/2 hours

Total hours: 2 1/2 hours

Positive: The meeting with Michael was very informative since we are working together on a ticket. He showed me at what scripts to look at and helped me understand how everything works. Besides the meeting, I took some time to look at all the scripts for Momentum to help get a better grasp of what to do for my ticket. 

Negative: Family matters unfortunately appeared out of no where and I had to miss our group meeting. I am a little behind as of now and need to catch up with the rest of the group. 

Upcoming: This week I look forward to working on the current ticket I have on Trello and work on fixing the sliding mechanic. Hopefully there aren't anymore random events that prevent me from attending the meetings.
